Python Jupyter Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Jupyter Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks showcasing my exploration, experimentation, and projects in the field of Python programming. While this portfolio is a work in progress and not yet complete, it provides a glimpse into my journey as a Python enthusiast and aspiring data scientist.

Here's a brief overview of the notebooks included in this portfolio:

Data Cleaning: Learn how to clean and preprocess raw data using Python, including techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formatting.

Data Manipulation: Explore methods for manipulating and transforming data using libraries like Pandas, covering tasks such as reshaping, merging, and aggregating datasets.

Data Visualization: Dive into the world of data visualization with Python, using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create insightful charts, graphs, and interactive plots.


Note: This portfolio is a work in progress and may be updated with additional notebooks and projects in the future. Stay tuned for more updates!
